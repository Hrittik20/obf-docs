# 4 Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual followed by OBF.
It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair.
Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

## 4.1 Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally

If the incident involves physical danger or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of any community member.
This can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the OBF.

If the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately, before reaching consensus, to diffuse the situation.
In ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a physical space.

In situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally, they must inform the appointed members as soon as possible, and report their actions for review within 24 hours.

## 4.2 Less-Urgent Situations

Upon receiving a report of an incident, the Code of Conduct committee will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- whether this is an ongoing situation
- whether there is a threat to anyone's physical safety
- what happened
- whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
- who, if anyone, was the bad actor

This information will be collected either in person or in writing.
The Code of Conduct committee will provide a written summary of the information surrounding the incident.
All participants will be anonymized in the summary report, referred to as "Community Member 1", "Member project 1", or "Board member 1" and so on.
The "de-anonymizing key" will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated reports against the same person over time.

The Code of Conduct committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week.
In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an updated and projected timeline for resolution.

## 4.3 Resolutions

The Code of Conduct committee will seek to agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question.
If the committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the appointed members from the OBF board will break the tie.
If these members are unable to take part in the discussion due to a conflict of interest, the chair of the OBF board will make the decision.

Possible responses may include:

* A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community members.
* A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member.
* A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the Code of Conduct.
* Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the scope of this Code of Conduct.
* A private in-person conversation between a member of the OBF Code of Conduct committee and the individual(s) involved.
  In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record-keeping.
* A private written reprimand from a member of the research team to the individual(s) involved.
  * A public announcement of an incident without the names and other identifiable details of the parties involved, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. on the listserv for a listserv violation; GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.).
  The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
* An imposed "time out" from online spaces.
 The OBF board will communicate this "time out" to the individual(s) involved.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all project spaces (GitHub, in-person events etc).
  The committee members will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or otherwise maintained.
  If a member of the community is removed from an event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they miss.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution.
The Code of Conduct committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.
However, the Code of Conduct committee is not required to act on this feedback.

## 4.5 Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest (for example, the reported incident involves a committee member, their family member, or someone with whom the committee member has a close academic or employment relationship is involved in a complaint), the committee member must immediately notify the other members and recuse themselves if necessary.

In the case that a Code of Conduct committee member is involved in a report, the member will be asked to recuse themselves from ongoing conversations, and they will not have access to reports after the enforcement decision has been made. Resolution action may also include removal of that member from the Code of Conduct committee.
