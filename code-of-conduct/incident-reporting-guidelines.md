# 3 Incident Reporting Guidelines

## 3.1 Reporting to the Code of Conduct Committee

Reports to the Code of Conduct Committee should be made by emailing [coc@open-bio.org](mailto:coc@open-bio.org). All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.
Currently appointed members to report any incident of violation of Code of Conduct are **Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, Malvika Sharan and Yo Yehudi**.

## 3.2 Alternate contact points

**Ombudsperson**: If you are uncomfortable emailing the OBF's Code of Conduct Committee, you can send your incident report to the ombudsperson. The designated ombudsperson for OBF is **Tracy Teal**, who can be contacted by emailing [ombuds@open-bio.org](mailto:ombuds@open-bio.org). Reports made to the ombudsperson will not be shared with the committee unless agreed with the reporters. 

**Board Members**: Alternatively, you can also contact all the members of the OBF board by emailing [board@open-bio.org](mailto:board@open-bio.org).

## 3.3 What to do if someone is in physical danger

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please immediately contact the appropriate emergency responders in your organisation or local area.

## 3.4 Code of Conduct Enforcement

A detailed enforcement policy is available in the [Enforcement Manual](./enforcement-manual.md).
