# The OBF Code of Conduct

## Overview

Below is a summary of the Open Bioinformatics Foundation Code of Conduct. 

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by the OBF's Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors in all platforms and events:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

In the coming months, a dedicated Code of Conduct committee will be established with the volunteer members designated and approved by the OBF Board.
The committee will be responsible for reviewing and keep the confidentiality of all the reports and enforcing the Code of Conduct.

Until the committee is established, we ask that you report any violation of the Code of Conduct to the following members of the OBF board: Bastian Greshake (email: ), Malvika Sharan (email: malvikasharan@gmail.com) and/or Yo Yehudi (Email: ). You can also reach out to all the OBF board members by emailing [board@openbio.org](mailto:board@openbio.org)

## Code of Conduct in detail

### Part 1. Introduction 

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) is a non-profit, volunteer-run group that promotes open-source software development and Open Science within the biological research community. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, sharing and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in OBF activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by OBF including, but not limited to, events, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, chat rooms, and Twitter. Event hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.  

The volunteer members designated and approved by the OBF Board will be responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.
All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.

Until the dedicated committee and contact details are created, you can reach out to the following members of the OBF board: Bastian Greshake (email: ), Malvika Sharan (email: malvikasharan@gmail.com) and/or Yo Yehudi.

### Part 2. OBF Code of Conduct

OBF is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people. We do not tolerate behavior that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level. 

Everyone who participates in the OBF events or activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by OBF including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, chat rooms and Twitter. Event hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which OBF resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information. 

#### Part 2.1 Expected behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors in all OBF events and platforms:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

#### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any OBF event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group  
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation  
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images  
- unwelcome sexual attention  
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact  
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put-downs  
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm  
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop  
- publication of private communication without consent  

#### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any OBF events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage OBF Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions as described in the reporting and report-handling guidelines.
